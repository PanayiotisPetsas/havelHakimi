# havelHakimi
This program uses the Havel-Hakimi algorithm. Based on an number of people given, and with each people telling us how many people they met before an event, this algorithm will return true if the answers are consistent (i.e. it's possible that everyone is telling the truth) and false if the answers are inconsistent (i.e. someone must be lying)
